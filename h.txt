Once a hare was roaming near a lake in a forest Suddenly he saw a tortoise and mocked at him saying  Hurry up you slow coach Do not you find life very dull taking so long to cover a few yards I could have run to the other side of the lake by now
The tortoise felt teased and dared the hare to a race The race was to be through the wood to a fixed goal
The hare agreed laughingly In a few minutes he was away and out of sight
What a funny race it is he said to himself I am already half way through But it is too too cold why not have a nap in the warm sunshine
The tortoise walked steadily on and on In a short time he passed by the sleeping hare
