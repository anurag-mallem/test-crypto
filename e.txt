A farmer had five sons They were strong and hardworking But they always quarrelled with
one another Sometimes they even fought The farmer wanted his sons to stop quarrelling
and fighting He wanted them to live in peace Plain word
s of advice or scolding did not have
much effect on these young people
The farmer always thought what to do to keep his sons unite One day he found an answer
to the problem So he called all his sons together He showed them a bundle of sticks and
said
I want any of you to break these sticks without separating them from the bundle
Each of the five sons tried one by one They used their full strength and skill But none of
them could break the sticks Then the old man separated the sticks and gave each of them
just a single stick to break They broke the sticks easily
The farmer said A single stick by itself is weak It is strong
